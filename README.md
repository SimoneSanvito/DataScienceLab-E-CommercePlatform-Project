# DataScienceLab-E-CommercePlatform-Project
Project made by using e-commerce data

With the technological evolution and the increasing spread of e-commerce platforms we have a world increasingly immersed in data, even for "online shopping".
The goal of the new data-driven companies is to make motivated decisions based on objective elements and not on instinct or sensations of the moment because, although some events are not predictable (such as, for example, the Covid-19 pandemic), basically all future events have similar circumstances and repeating patterns.

In this project I had the opportunity to work with @danielepoterti, @alessiosanvito, @fabriziomerlo; our goal was to explore and process data in order to find information useful for the companies; in particular we applied a daily rolling regression using ARMA and Facebook Prophet to see which library is the best for this purpose.
